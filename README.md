Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis through Brain MRI Analysis
Introduction and Relevance
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder and the most common type of dementia. It leads to the atrophy of the brain and death of brain cells, significantly impacting memory, thinking, behavior, and the ability to perform everyday activities. Although it is the most prevalent form of dementia, diagnosing Alzheimer's disease can be challenging. It often requires a comprehensive approach that includes medical history assessment, neuropsychological testing, and brain imaging to accurately identify the condition.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by providing detailed images of the brain's structure. Here's how MRI helps in diagnosing this disease:

Detection of Brain Atrophy
Assessment of Disease Progression
Research and Biomarker Identification
